# # channel_settings (sequence: map)
# #   env var string delimiter: ','
# #   A list of mappings that allows overriding certain settings for a
# #   single channel. Each list item should include at least the "channel"
# #   key and the setting you would like to override.
# # 
# channel_settings: []

# # override_channels_enabled (bool)
# #   Permit use of the --override-channels command-line flag.
# # 
# override_channels_enabled: true

# # custom_channels (map: primitive)
# #   A map of key-value pairs where the key is a channel name and the value
# #   is a channel location. Channels defined here override the default
# #   'channel_alias' value. The channel name (key) is not included in the
# #   channel location (value).  For example, to override the location of
# #   the 'conda-forge' channel where the url to repodata is
# #   https://anaconda-repo.dev/packages/conda-forge/linux-64/repodata.json,
# #   add an entry 'conda-forge: https://anaconda-repo.dev/packages'.

# # custom_multichannels (map: sequence)
# #   A multichannel is a metachannel composed of multiple channels. The two
# #   reserved multichannels are 'defaults' and 'local'. The 'defaults'
# #   multichannel is customized using the 'default_channels' parameter. The
# #   'local' multichannel is a list of file:// channel locations where
# #   conda-build stashes successfully-built packages.  Other multichannels
# #   can be defined with custom_multichannels, where the key is the
# #   multichannel name and the value is a list of channel names and/or
# #   channel urls.
# # 
# custom_multichannels: {}

# # migrated_channel_aliases (sequence: primitive)
# #   env var string delimiter: ','
# #   A list of previously-used channel_alias values. Useful when switching
# #   between different Anaconda Repository instances.
# # 
# migrated_channel_aliases: []

# # migrated_custom_channels (map: primitive)
# #   A map of key-value pairs where the key is a channel name and the value
# #   is the previous location of the channel.
# # 
# migrated_custom_channels: {}

# # add_anaconda_token (bool)
# #   aliases: add_binstar_token
# #   In conjunction with the anaconda command-line client (installed with
# #   `conda install anaconda-client`), and following logging into an
# #   Anaconda Server API site using `anaconda login`, automatically apply a
# #   matching private token to enable access to private packages and
# #   channels.
# # 
# add_anaconda_token: true

# # allow_non_channel_urls (bool)
# #   Warn, but do not fail, when conda detects a channel url is not a valid
# #   channel.
# # 
# allow_non_channel_urls: false

# # restore_free_channel (bool)
# #   "                 Add the "free" channel back into defaults, behind
# #   "main" in priority. The "free"                 channel was removed
# #   from the collection of default channels in conda 4.7.0.
